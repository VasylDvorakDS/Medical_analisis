NCT05307536,Autologous BMMNCs Combined With Educational Intervention for ASD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05307536,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell infusion combined with educational intervention for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Inclusion criteria: Male/Female patients diagnosed with Autism disorder based on DSM-V scale, the patient is between 3 to 7 years old, a patient has a medium level to server level of autism (CARS score\>=30 to \<50), VARS-2 \>=50, patient's parent or caregiver must have the educational level of high school or above, patient's family has given consent to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria for treatment group: patient above seven years of age and smaller than 3-year old, autistic patients having epilepsy, hydrocephalus with ventricular drain, allergy to anesthetic agents, severe health conditions such as cancer, failure of heart, lung, liver, or kidney, active infections, children with birth defects of the spine.",NO,Autism Spectrum Disorder,COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Autologous BMMNCs transplantation and educational intervention|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Educational intervention,"Change of severity of ASD after intervention through the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5). DSM-5 describes three levels of increasing severity of ASD.DSM-5 describes three levels of increasing severity of ASD, from (1) (""requiring support"") to (2) (""requiring substantial support""), and finally to (3) (""requiring very substantial support"")., 2 months, 6 months, 12 months after the first BMMNCs infusion|Change of severity of ASD after intervention through the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) consists of 14 domains assessing behaviors associated with ASD, with a 15th domain rating general impressions of ASD. Each domain is scored on a scale ranging from one to four; higher scores are associated with a higher level of impairment. Total scores can range from a low of 15 to a high of 60; scores below 30 indicate that the individual is in the non-autistic range, scores between 30 and 36.5 indicate mild to moderate autism, and scores from 37 to 60 indicate severe autism., 2 months, 6 months, 12 months after the first BMMNCs infusion|Changes in social interaction; adaptive behaviour; daily living skills through Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale, The Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale second version (VABS-2) is a semi-structured interview measuring adaptive behavior with standard scores (M = 100, SD = 15). We define proficiency as a standard score of 85 or above (i.e., 1 SD below the mean). This metric for ""not impaired"" is used in other optimal outcome studies and the learning disability literature. We define growth as an improvement of at least 1 SD in standard scores (15 points) from T1 to T2. Improvement of 1 SD in clinical trials is considered a large effect size., 2 months, 6 months, 12 months after the first BMMNCs infusion|Changes in social interaction; adaptive behaviour; daily living skills through Clinical Global Impression Improvement, The Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI) is a rating scale that measures symptom severity and treatment response. The severity is categorized into seven levels: 1) not present (no ASD); 2) barely evident ASD symptoms; 3) mild ASD symptoms; 4) moderate ASD symptoms; 5) moderately severe ASD symptoms; 6) severe ASD symptoms or 7) very severe ASD symptoms.

The response of each patient is also divided into seven levels: level 1) very much improved; level 2) much improved; level 3) minimally improved; level 4) no change; level 5) minimally worse; level 6) much worse; level 7) very much worse., 2 months, 6 months, 12 months after the first BMMNCs infusion","Changes in health-related quality of life using Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventoryâ„¢ 4.0 Generic Core Scales - Parent Report (PedsQL) is a tool for assessing the HRQoL of children aged 2-18.

PedsQL includes four domains (physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning) and is scored using three levels: no problems (1), some problems (2), or many problems (3). The PedsQL has 23 items, and scores on the standard portion range from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the best possible quality of life., 2 months, 6 months, 12 months after the first BMMNCs infusion",,Vinmec Research Institute of Stem Cell and Gene Technology,,ALL,CHILD,PHASE2,54,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,ISC.19.50,2021-12-26,2023-06-30,2023-07-30,2022-04-01,,2024-06-04,"Vinmec Research Institute of Stem Cell and Gene Technology, Hanoi, 10000, Vietnam",
